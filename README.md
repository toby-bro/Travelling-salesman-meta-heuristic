# Travelling-salesman-meta-heuristic
Travelling salesman problem resolution through two meta-heuristic methods : 
  - Ant Colony Otimization (main_ant.py)
    - needs ville.py and fourmi.py to function properly
  - Simulated annealing (main_recuit.py)

Those are first drafts of the programs...
I'll comment them and simplify them as soon as possible
